  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <strong>December 11, 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>Quick summary</h2>
  <p>This website is a personal/fun project (no registration required). <strong>We do not collect or store personal data.</strong> If you simply play and browse, nothing about you is saved on this site.</p>

  <h2>No registration & no direct data collection</h2>
  <p>There is no sign-up, login, or account system. We do not request or store names, email addresses, passwords, or other personal identifiers.</p>

  <h2>Third-party ads and services</h2>
  <p>To keep this project running, the site may display ads provided by third-party networks such as GameMonetizer and Google Ads. These third parties may collect information (for example: cookies, device identifiers, and browsing behavior) to deliver and measure ads, and to provide interest-based advertising.</p>
  <div class="note">
    <strong>Important:</strong> This site itself does not collect personal data, but the ad networks it uses operate independently and may process data about your visit. If you want details about what those networks collect and how they use it, please review their privacy policies and choices.
  </div>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>The site itself uses only minimal technical cookies (if any) required for basic operation. Ad networks may set their own cookies — these are controlled by the third-party providers, not by this site.</p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can block or clear cookies in your browser settings.</li>
    <li>Google offers controls for ad personalization (search for "Google Ad Settings" for details).</li>
    <li>Use your browser's privacy tools or extensions if you want to limit third-party tracking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Kids</h2>
  <p>This site is intended for general audiences. If you are under the applicable age in your jurisdiction, please use this site only with parental permission. The site does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>If anything changes (for example we add a feature that collects info), this page will be updated with the new date and a clear explanation of what changed.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, email: <em>your-email@example.com</em> (replace with your contact address) or update this page as needed.</p>

    <p>Site purpose: For fun — no registration required and no data collected by the site itself. Third-party ads may operate independently.</p>
