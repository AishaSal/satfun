  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello — im iSatoor, this is a small personal/fun website made with Love and fun for gaming , and made with <strong>GameMonetizer + Google Ads</strong> to show a game/demo and help cover hosting costs. There is no registration and no user accounts.</p>

  <p>I build small games / demos and share them here for fun. If you enjoy it, a click on an ad helps keep the site alive — thank you!</p>
